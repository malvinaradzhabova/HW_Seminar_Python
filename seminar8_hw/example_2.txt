Jackie's just 17, and hard to please
She steps on the scene, like a gypsy queen
And she's looking at everybody, with a secret smile
She got a black tattoo on her body
And it says
"When I die, yeah, you know I'll be ready to go"
"When I die, yeah, you know I'll be ready to go"
"When I die, yeah, you know I'll be ready to go"
"When I die, yeah, you know I'll be ready to go"
"When I die, yeah, you know I'll be ready to go"
"When I die, yeah, you know I'll be ready to go"
"When I die, yeah, you know I'll be ready to go"
